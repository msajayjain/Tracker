The Strategy: GitHub Flow
The core rule is: The master branch is always deployable. No one works on it directly. Every change happens in a "Feature Branch."
1. Create a Feature Branch (Locally)
Whenever a user wants to add a feature or fix a bug, they create a new branch.
git checkout master (Go to the main road)

# Pull the latest changes first
git pull origin master

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/add-login-page

teesting

new repo
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
Go to GitHub → New Repository

Name: your-project

❌ Do NOT add README or .gitignore (already local)
Copy the HTTPS URL.

git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<org-or-user>/your-project.git
git push -u origin main
